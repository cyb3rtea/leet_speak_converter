# L337_5P3AK_C0NV3R73R

A simple Python script used to convert plain text to leet speak and vise versa

## NOTE: WIP

This project is still a ___work-in-progress___  
NOT IMPLEMENTED:  
        Being able to convert files -> this will be comming soon

## Requirements

Python 3.9

## Usage

Run the script with '-h' to get the output usage.
```
python3 l33t_speak.py -h  
```
But here is the current output anyway
```
USAGE: python3 l33t_speak.py [option] [string | filename]

OPTIONS: 
-c      Convert from regular text to leet speak
-d      Convert from leet speak to regular text
-h      Display the usage of this script

EG:
        python3 l33t_speak.py -c hello
        python3 l33t_speak.py -d 43110
        python3 l33t_speak.py -c text.txt

COMMON ISSUES:
        - W.I.P.: converting files has not been implemented yet
        - If [String | Filenme] contains spaces, surround with quotes
        - Make sure the string or filename is always the last argument
```
